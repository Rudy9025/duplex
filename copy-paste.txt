Great! Thunder Client works just like Postman and is perfect for testing this Spring Boot API.

Here’s exactly how to use Thunder Client with the /compare API:

⸻

Step-by-Step: Send Request in Thunder Client
	1.	Method: POST
	2.	URL: http://localhost:8080/compare
	3.	Tab: Go to the Body tab
	4.	Select: Form (NOT JSON or Text)

⸻

Add Form Fields:

Key	Value	Type
file1	Select your first CSV file	File
file2	Select your second CSV file	File
col1	Column index from file1 (e.g. 1)	Text
col2	Column index from file2 (e.g. 2)	Text

Column indexes are 0-based. So first column = 0, second = 1, etc.

⸻

Hit “Send”

You’ll get a JSON response like:

[
  {
    "index": 1,
    "value1": "Apple",
    "value2": "apple",
    "status": "Matched"
  },
  {
    "index": 2,
    "value1": "Orange",
    "value2": "Banana",
    "status": "MisMatched"
  }
]

Let me know if you want to enhance the output (e.g. match count summary, CSV download, or column name support).
